Mixed Messages a Codecademy project
=====================================
Message generator program
-------------------------
### Main concept
Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.

### How it works
Every time the user runs the program a random message is genrated. The message is made of **two parts** a *fix part* and a *random part*. When the message is generated a random number is genrated from the length of the *messages object*
that gets the *fixed part*. The *random part* is an array which from a random element will be genrated based on another random number genration but this time the *random array's* length is used.
